# Concave Mirror Focal Length Verifier

## Overview

This Java program uses the **mirror formula** from physics to calculate the focal length of a concave mirror based on given object and image distances. It then checks whether the computed focal length lies within the range **21.0 cm to 25.0 cm inclusive**, as required in the **WAKISHA MOCK Exams** at **Victoria University**.

### Mirror Formula

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u}
\]

Where:
- `f` = focal length
- `v` = image distance (positive for real images)
- `u` = object distance (negative for concave mirrors)

## Features

- Computes focal length using image and object distances
- Validates if the focal length is within the required range
- Clear console output with step-by-step values

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concave-mirror-checker.git
   cd concave-mirror-checker
